Algorithms : 
-------------
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Declare three variables a,b,c
Step 3 : Read the values of a,b,c
Step 4 :   First find the maximum of three values
Step 5 : Check a >b and a>c then print a is Maximum otherwise go to Step 6
Step 6 : Check b>a and b>c then print b  is Minimum otherwise go to Step 7
Step 7 : print c is Maximum
Step 8 : Now finding the Minimum of three values
Step 9 : check a<b and a<c then print a is Minimum otherwise go to Step 10
Step 10 :check b<a and b<c then print b is Minimum otherwise go to Step 11
Step 11 : print c is Minimum
Step 12 :Stop
