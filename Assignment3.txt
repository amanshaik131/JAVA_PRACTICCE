3. Find the area and peremeter of circle, rectangle and square.

Ans)Algorithm for Finding  the area and peremeter of circle, rectangle and square.:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 :  Start
Step 2 :  Declare the variables radius,length,breath,side,Area,Peri
Step 3 :  Input the radius,length,breadth,side
Step 4 : Perform Area of Circle and store it in area such as Area=3.14*radius*radius; and
Step 5 : Perform Perimeter of Circle and store it in peri such as Peri=2*3.14*radius; and then
Step 6:  Print Area and Peri  
Step 7 : Perform area of Rectangle and store it in area such as Area =length*breadth;
Step 8 : Perform perimeter of Rectangle and store it in Peri as Peri=2*(length*breadth);
Step 9 : Print Area and Peri  
Step10 : Perform perimeter of Square and store it in area as Area=side *side;
Step11 : Perform perimeter of Square and store it in peri as Peri=4*side;
Step12 : Print Area and Peri  
Step13 : Stop

 




area of circle   =3.14 *r*r;
Perimeter of circle =2*3.14*r;

area of rect=>l*b;
peri=>2*(l*b);

area of square =>s*s'
perimeter of square=>4*s;
